      <p>Hello!! I am Mar√≠a Suescum, Electromedicine Professional and full-stack web developer. In recent years I have worked in various fields of work focused on customer and commercial service in areas such as Health and Finance. In 2021 I got to know the world of web development and I am passionate about learning about these technologies, which is why in 2022 I was presented with the opportunity to study full-stack development under a technology scholarship program with Programate Academy, where I received the necessary guidance to enter this entire Developer world and I started to carry out my first projects in frontend and backend with various technologies</p>
